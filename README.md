## About the project:

### âœ… Objective:
The goal of this project was to create a back-end for reading/book tracker app such as [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/). One additional challenge I gave my self was to use a new IDE, throughout the bootcamp we used Eclipse and while I didn't have a strong preference one way or another I felt exposing myself to new IDE would be a good learning experience.

This project is a continuation of previous front-end projects I've done:
- [First Iteration](https://github.com/tjpoo92/library)
- [Second Iteration](https://github.com/tjpoo92/goodreads-clone)

#### Additional Items To Do:

* [ ] Add/Change PUTs to be PATCHs, allows some additional flexibility and usabilitiy to change only exactly what is needed
* [ ] Add API authentication
* [ ] Hook up to a front-end
* [ ] User authentication

### Retrospective

ðŸ“ˆ Project is still in progress, but here's an early retro...

This was my final project for my back-end bootcamp and it was extremely fun to work on. This was my first project I worked on that allowed me to use a bunch of techniques and best practices that I had picked up from a previous job and it allowed my to very easily write my user stories and then work through each of those stories one-by-one and complete the project with plenty of time to space. There's still more I plan to do for this project, but it is currently in a state to submit for my bootcamp final.

#### Things to Improve Upon:

ðŸ“ˆ Project is still in progress...

#### Additional Notes:
The base of this project started from a blog post ([not the blog post I read but itâ€™s a good representation](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ev3qw7/how-to-quit-apple-microsoft-google-facebook-amazon)) I read about disconnecting yourself from the big technology companies such as Amazon and Google and how difficult it was to do so since theyâ€™re so ingrained into our daily lives.

After reading that blog post, I started slowly switching my own habits. I started using alternatives to many Google and Amazon products such as Proton Mail (Gmail), HERE WeGo (Google Maps), DropBox (Google Drive), and Musicolet (Amazon Music, Google Music), however I was struggling to find a good app to replace GoodReads, which is owned by Amazon.

So, I decided to start trying to build my own and this is my first iteration at a back-end for my own version of a GoodReads app.
